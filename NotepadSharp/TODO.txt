--Bugs
-Maintain binding list order
-change binding for file explorer for an ItemsSource so files and folders will be sorted correctly when added to the collection after it's created

--Features
-More persistence
-Async capabilities for lua scripts (coroutines or something, allowing use of C# tasks is causing unrecoverable exceptions from NLua)
-Syntax highlighting
-Auto-Completion

--In progress
    -Shadow copy of the edited file (like notepad++) 
        --Still need a timer to track changes to the original file
