--Bugs
-Maintain binding list order
-change binding for file explorer for an ItemsSource so files and folders will be sorted correctly when added to the collection after it's created

--Features
-More persistence
-Async capabilities for lua scripts (coroutines or something, allowing use of C# tasks is causing unrecoverable exceptions from NLua)
-Syntax highlighting
-Auto-Completion

--In progress
    -Shadow copy of the edited file (like notepad++) 
        --Still need to track changes/deletions of the original file to know when to warn about the out of date copy

    -File explorer move to next instance of letter (e.g. when in the tree view, hit a key and go to the first file/folder starting with that letter)
