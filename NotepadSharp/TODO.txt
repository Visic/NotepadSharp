--Bugs
-Maintain tab order for open documents
-Making a new keybinding (starting by typing in the lua/path) refocuses the textbox while typing

--Improvements
-change the key binding execution/key press handler to be a singleton

--Features
-More persistence
-Async capabilities for lua scripts (coroutines or something, allowing use of C# tasks is causing unrecoverable exceptions from NLua)
-Syntax highlighting
-Auto-Completion
-File comparison for "Dirty" files
-Multi-edit
-Search in file for text/regex
-Middle mouse click tabs to close them
-drawing canvas (to workout graphs, jot notes, whatever)
